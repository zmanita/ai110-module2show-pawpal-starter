# PawPal+ (Module 2 Project)

You are building **PawPal+**, a Streamlit app that helps a pet owner plan care tasks for their pet.

## Scenario

A busy pet owner needs help staying consistent with pet care. They want an assistant that can:

- Track pet care tasks (walks, feeding, meds, enrichment, grooming, etc.)
- Consider constraints (time available, priority, owner preferences)
- Produce a daily plan and explain why it chose that plan

Your job is to design the system first (UML), then implement the logic in Python, then connect it to the Streamlit UI.

## What you will build

Your final app should:

- Let a user enter basic owner + pet info
- Let a user add/edit tasks (duration + priority at minimum)
- Generate a daily schedule/plan based on constraints and priorities
- Display the plan clearly (and ideally explain the reasoning)
- Include tests for the most important scheduling behaviors

## Getting started

### Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Suggested workflow

1. Read the scenario carefully and identify requirements and edge cases.
2. Draft a UML diagram (classes, attributes, methods, relationships).
3. Convert UML into Python class stubs (no logic yet).
4. Implement scheduling logic in small increments.
5. Add tests to verify key behaviors.
6. Connect your logic to the Streamlit UI in `app.py`.
7. Refine UML so it matches what you actually built.

## Testing PawPal+
Use this command to run tests: python -m pytest
The tests cover:
1. Any task's is_completed status is changed from False to True once user marks it done.
2. Adding a task to a pet increases the pet's task count.
3. Sorting tasks by due time orders them correctly in pawpal_system. 
4. Marking a daily task complete creates a new task for the following day.
5. The system identifies conflicting tasks based on due times. Task1 ending at 9:30 and task2 ending at 9:30 produces a conflict.
6. The system identifies non-conflicting tasks based on due times. Task1 ending at 9:29 and task2 starting at 9:30 do not produce a conflict.
